# Monochrome Minimalist Minesweeper
My favorite game, all in my favorite color, a dream come true. And if your favorite color is pink, purple, blue or green and your favorite game is Minesweeper, then your dream has come true as well.
## How did I make this
HTML, CSS, vanilla JS
## What was the hardest part?
Making all the buttons in a grid. I didn't really know what I was doing back then.
## Future Work
- ~~Add a toggle to flag mode (because I like to play on my phone)~~
- ~~Choose your favorite color~~
- ~~Dark Mode? (For playing at night)~~
- Add a timer
- Choose board size and mine count
- ~~Reveal uncovered mines when losing~~
